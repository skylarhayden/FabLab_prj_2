FabLab_prj_2
============
The project was to create and print a digital form by merging at least two clean 3D scans of one or more humans. I used the scans of Karen and Cole. I tried to use the one of myself but it would break to pieces everytime I tried to clean up the scan. I also kept crashing meshmixer every time I tried to put my file with the one of Karen. I eventually gave up after crashing the program 4 or 5 times and just used Cole and Karen. I was trying to keep it simple and was having a lot of trouble working in meshmixer so I just tried to join the scan of Karen with the one of Cole and created a scary looking bust where Karen was basically protruding from Cole. Once I put this into OpenSCAD I thought the worst of my problems were behind me, but I was wrong. Once I put the scan into OpenSCAD, the object was on its side and refused to level out and then also wouldn't export, it just said nothing was there. That is why the only documentation is of the scans in OpenSCAD.
